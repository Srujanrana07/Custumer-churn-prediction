# 📊 Churn Risk Score Prediction

A machine learning project designed to predict **customer churn risk scores** using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave a service so that companies can take proactive steps for retention.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses. This project builds an end-to-end ML pipeline that:
- Cleans and preprocesses the dataset
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Engineers meaningful features
- Trains ML models
- Predicts churn risk categories
- Generates outputs for further business analysis

## 🧠 Objective
Predict the **churn_risk_score** for each customer:
- 0 — Low Risk
- 1 — Medium Risk
- 2 — High Risk

## 📁 Dataset Description
The project uses:
- train.csv — Training data
- test.csv — Test data

Dataset includes demographics, usage patterns, purchase behaviour, and communication history.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
